#### University Course – MDS

  The following repository is part of a **University Course – MDS** that followed the process of developing a software – from scratch. 

That involved writing the customer feature list, the technical and non-technical requirements, the backlog, the unit tests and finally the product itself. The process is a tedious one especially if it involves one person that plays the role of the customer, of the developer and of the marketing assistant.

- [x] Technical/Non-technical details
- [x] Possible Implementations
- [x] UML Design Pattern
- [x] Unit Tests


The software that the project is based on is a tool that me and my brother @AntonVonDelta developed in 2013, as part of a local competition that involved building polymorphic, modular AV evading CNC devices. One of the first versions was actually quite popular in our school, though it was a ‘non-invasive’ version; The following code Is a refactoring of the server built for that first version, and proves the importance of a team in the grand-scheme of a project.
