#### University Course – MDS

  The following repository is part of a **University Course – MDS** that followed the process of developing a software – from scratch. 

That involved writing the customer feature list, the technical and non-technical requirements, the backlog, the unit tests and finally the product itself. The process is a tedious one especially if it involves one person that plays the role of the customer, of the developer and of the marketing assistant.

The software that the project is based on is a tool that me and my brother @AntonVonDelta developed in 2013, as part of a local competition that involved building polymorphic, modular AV evading CC devices. One of the first versions was actually quite popular in  school, though it was a ‘non-invasive’ version; The following code Is a refactoring of the server built for that first version, and proves the importance of teamwork in the grand-scheme of a project. 

In this refactoring, the server plays the role of a Remote Administration Tool that can assist server adminsitrators in their tasks.
